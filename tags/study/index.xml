      <description>To complete my master&amp;rsquo;s degree at the University of Applied Sciences, I wrote my master&amp;rsquo;s thesis titled An Educational Programming Environment for Teaching the Principles of Machine Learning using LEGO MINDSTORMS.
Abstract The German education system is on the verge of raising a generation of digital illiterates. We are in desperate need of up-to-date and motivating teaching content and tools for computer science education to make prevailing topics such as artificial intelligence more accessible to the general public.</description>

      <description>In 2016 and 2017 I wrote my thesis about conversational interfaces. My goal was to establish a design and development process for conversational interfaces. I mainly based my theories on Pangaro&amp;rsquo;s design for conversation, Grice&amp;rsquo;s cooperative principles and &amp;ldquo;The Media Equation&amp;rdquo; by Reeves and Nass.
To proof my theoretical concepts I developed a facebook chatbot with wit.ai that was able to look up recipes. The bot was tested in a live trial and in a survey testers were able to judge the effectiveness of the conversation with the chatbot.</description>

      <description>In 2017 I was part of the team that participated in the Audi Autonomous Driving Cup. My main task was to implement Occupancy Grid Maps, which were used for object detection and parking.
The following year I took over team leadership and focused on the implementation of the World Service.

      <description>In 2017 and 2018 I took over the project management of a student project for two semesters. This project is a mandatory part of the Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s and Master&amp;rsquo;s program in which a team of 10-15 students develops a software over two semesters. The bachelor students function as the development team and the master students take over the project management part. Since the development is based on Scrum, the master students act as Software Architect, Product Owner and Scrum Master.</description>
