      <description>To complete my master&amp;rsquo;s degree at the University of Applied Sciences, I wrote my master&amp;rsquo;s thesis titled An Educational Programming Environment for Teaching the Principles of Machine Learning using LEGO MINDSTORMS.
Abstract The German education system is on the verge of raising a generation of digital illiterates. We are in desperate need of up-to-date and motivating teaching content and tools for computer science education to make prevailing topics such as artificial intelligence more accessible to the general public.</description>
