      <description>As part of the advanced seminar I attended in my second master semester, I wrote a paper with three fellow students about the utilization of robots in german highschools. The paper was accepted for publication at the student conference for computer science. The full text can be found here.</description>

      <description>Today I present to you: Another Machine Learning tutorial that no one asked for.
As part of my master thesis, I developed a workflow and exercises to bring Machine Learning (ML) to LEGO Mindstorms EV3. To give you a bit of background about my thesis, my aim is to create an educational programming environment to teach high school students about Machine Learning algorithms using LEGO Mindstorms. Finding a suitable task for teaching kids (or rather teenagers) ML algorithms wasn’t the easiest considering the limited resources and sensors the EV3 has to offer.</description>

      <description>My main task the past two weeks was to figure out the learning objectives for a Machine Learning course. This is not an easy task considering that most courses you find online are designed for adults, more specifically adults with a background in computer science or another STEM field. Therefore, my work this week focused on the following three subtasks:
 Examine different ML online courses and summarize the main learning objectives Look into teaching contents of german math classes (grade 8 to 12) Merge these outcomes to compose the learning objectives for my course  One and Two were quite straightforward.</description>
