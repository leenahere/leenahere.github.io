      <description>My main task the past two weeks was to figure out the learning objectives for a Machine Learning course. This is not an easy task considering that most courses you find online are designed for adults, more specifically adults with a background in computer science or another STEM field. Therefore, my work this week focused on the following three subtasks:
 Examine different ML online courses and summarize the main learning objectives Look into teaching contents of german math classes (grade 8 to 12) Merge these outcomes to compose the learning objectives for my course  One and Two were quite straightforward.</description>
