      <description>In 2017 I was part of the team that participated in the Audi Autonomous Driving Cup. My main task was to implement Occupancy Grid Maps, which were used for object detection and parking.
The following year I took over team leadership and focused on the implementation of the World Service.

      <description>Code Girls is a non-profit organization that offers workshops and lectures related to computer science for females. This year, we held an Arduino workshop for programming novices. The workshop followed a collaborative project-based approach and the participants were engaged in building a smart home inspired by Buster Keaton&amp;rsquo;s electric house. Each team built a single room, deciding on sensors, actuators and functionalities individually. In the end, we assembled all rooms to one large smart home.</description>
