      <description>Today I present to you: Another Machine Learning tutorial that no one asked for.
As part of my master thesis, I developed a workflow and exercises to bring Machine Learning (ML) to LEGO Mindstorms EV3. To give you a bit of background about my thesis, my aim is to create an educational programming environment to teach high school students about Machine Learning algorithms using LEGO Mindstorms. Finding a suitable task for teaching kids (or rather teenagers) ML algorithms wasnâ€™t the easiest considering the limited resources and sensors the EV3 has to offer.</description>
