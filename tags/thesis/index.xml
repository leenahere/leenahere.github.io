      <description>To complete my master&amp;rsquo;s degree at the University of Applied Sciences, I wrote my master&amp;rsquo;s thesis titled An Educational Programming Environment for Teaching the Principles of Machine Learning using LEGO MINDSTORMS.
Abstract The German education system is on the verge of raising a generation of digital illiterates. We are in desperate need of up-to-date and motivating teaching content and tools for computer science education to make prevailing topics such as artificial intelligence more accessible to the general public.</description>

      <description>In 2016 and 2017 I wrote my thesis about conversational interfaces. My goal was to establish a design and development process for conversational interfaces. I mainly based my theories on Pangaro&amp;rsquo;s design for conversation, Grice&amp;rsquo;s cooperative principles and &amp;ldquo;The Media Equation&amp;rdquo; by Reeves and Nass.
To proof my theoretical concepts I developed a facebook chatbot with wit.ai that was able to look up recipes. The bot was tested in a live trial and in a survey testers were able to judge the effectiveness of the conversation with the chatbot.</description>
