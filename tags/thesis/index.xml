      <description>In 2016 and 2017 I wrote my thesis about conversational interfaces. My goal was to establish a design and development process for conversational interfaces. I mainly based my theories on Pangaro&amp;rsquo;s design for conversation, Grice&amp;rsquo;s cooperative principles and &amp;ldquo;The Media Equation&amp;rdquo; by Reeves and Nass.
To proof my theoretical concepts I programmed a facebook chatbot with wit.ai that was able to look up recipes. The bot was tested in a live trial and in a survey testers were able to judge the effectiveness of the conversation with the chatbot.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning with Lego Mindstorms EV3</title>

      <description>Today I present to you: Another Machine Learning tutorial that no one asked for.
As part of my master thesis, I developed a workflow and exercises to bring Machine Learning (ML) to LEGO Mindstorms EV3. To give you a bit of background about my thesis, my aim is to create an educational programming environment to teach high school students about Machine Learning algorithms using LEGO Mindstorms. Finding a suitable task for teaching kids (or rather teenagers) ML algorithms wasn’t the easiest considering the limited resources and sensors the EV3 has to offer.</description>

      <title>Doing the Math</title>

      <description>My main task the past two weeks was to figure out the learning objectives for a Machine Learning course. This is not an easy task considering that most courses you find online are designed for adults, more specifically adults with a background in computer science or another STEM field. Therefore, my work this week focused on the following three subtasks:
 Examine different ML online courses and summarize the main learning objectives Look into teaching contents of german math classes (grade 8 to 12) Merge these outcomes to compose the learning objectives for my course  One and Two were quite straightforward.</description>

Initially, I was asked to write the related work abstract for my thesis this week to summarize all the relevant papers and other sources I&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled upon so far. While googling (yes, I google a lot these days) how to best write related work abstracts, I figured why not do some general research on master thesis requirements (yes, I should&amp;rsquo;ve probably googled that a while ago).</description>

This week I started my research for my masters thesis. To say &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m struggling&amp;rdquo; would be an understatement. The research part of any thesis is probably the most crucial part of the whole odyssey. It&amp;rsquo;s the part that sets the tone for the next 6 months. I guess struggling with the research will mean less struggle with the rest of the process. Hopefully…right?</description>
