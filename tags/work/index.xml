      <description>In 2014, I began working in customer support at Ulysses. I helped customers deal with the macOS and iOS app, recorded feature requests and reported bugs. When I came back to Leipzig after my internship in 2016, I switched roles and started co-developing the app. I implemented new features like reading time goals and fixed bugs.</description>
