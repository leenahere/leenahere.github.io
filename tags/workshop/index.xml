      <description>Code Girls is a non-profit organization that offers workshops and lectures related to computer science for females. This year, we held an Arduino workshop for programming novices. The workshop followed a collaborative project-based approach and the participants were engaged in building a smart home inspired by Buster Keaton&amp;rsquo;s electric house. Each team built a single room, deciding on sensors, actuators and functionalities individually. In the end, we assembled all rooms to one large smart home.</description>
