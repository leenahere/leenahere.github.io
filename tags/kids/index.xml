      <description>Jugend hackt, which is a hackathon for kids and teenagers, takes place in cities all over Germany. At the hackathon children and teenagers (12-18 years old) come together for a weekend and work on various projects in groups. The event is all about improving the world with code and the kids can be creative and pursue their individual goals while learning about different technologies. In August 2018 the hackathon took place in Halle and I mentored a group of the younger kids who programmed a website to provide information about chicken farming in Germany.</description>
