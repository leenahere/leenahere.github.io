      <title>Bachelor Thesis</title>

      <description>In 2016 and 2017 I wrote my thesis about conversational interfaces. My goal was to establish a design and development process for conversational interfaces. I mainly based my theories on Pangaro&amp;rsquo;s design for conversation, Grice&amp;rsquo;s cooperative principles and &amp;ldquo;The Media Equation&amp;rdquo; by Reeves and Nass.
To proof my theoretical concepts I programmed a facebook chatbot with wit.ai that was able to look up recipes. The bot was tested in a live trial and in a survey testers were able to judge the effectiveness of the conversation with the chatbot.</description>

      <description>In 2017 I was part of the team that participated in the Audi Autonomous Driving Cup. My main task was to implement Occupancy Grid Maps, which were used for object detection and parking.
The following year I took over team leadership and focused on the implementation of the World Service.

      <description>In 2014, I began working in customer support at Ulysses. I helped customers deal with the macOS and iOS app, recorded feature requests and reported bugs. When I came back to Leipzig after my internship in 2016, I switched roles and started co-developing the app. I implemented new features like reading time goals and fixed bugs.</description>

      <description>In 2017 and 2018 I took over the project management of a student project for two semesters. This project is a mandatory part of the Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s and Master&amp;rsquo;s program in which a team of 10-15 students develops a software over two semesters. The bachelor students function as the development team and the master students take over the project management part. Since the development is based on Scrum, the master students act as Software Architect, Product Owner and Scrum Master.</description>

      <description>Jugend hackt, which is a hackathon for kids and teenagers, takes place in cities all over Germany. At the hackathon children and teenagers (12-18 years old) come together for a weekend and work on various projects in groups. The event is all about improving the world with code and the kids can be creative and pursue their individual goals while learning about different technologies. In August 2018 the hackathon took place in Halle and I mentored a group of the younger kids who programmed a website to provide information about chicken farming in Germany.</description>

What&amp;rsquo;s crackin&amp;rsquo;? I haven&amp;rsquo;t written on here for a long long time. Initially, I wanted to update this blog every week. Mostly for myself to stay organized. That&amp;rsquo;s the thing with plans though, they&amp;rsquo;re just plans and not reality in most cases. For the most part, I didn&amp;rsquo;t write anything the past weeks, because I tried to find the right topic to write about next to keep these nice topic related posts going.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning with Lego Mindstorms EV3</title>

      <description>Today I present to you: Another Machine Learning tutorial that no one asked for.
As part of my master thesis, I developed a workflow and exercises to bring Machine Learning (ML) to LEGO Mindstorms EV3. To give you a bit of background about my thesis, my aim is to create an educational programming environment to teach high school students about Machine Learning algorithms using LEGO Mindstorms. Finding a suitable task for teaching kids (or rather teenagers) ML algorithms wasn’t the easiest considering the limited resources and sensors the EV3 has to offer.</description>

      <title>Doing the Math</title>

      <description>My main task the past two weeks was to figure out the learning objectives for a Machine Learning course. This is not an easy task considering that most courses you find online are designed for adults, more specifically adults with a background in computer science or another STEM field. Therefore, my work this week focused on the following three subtasks:
 Examine different ML online courses and summarize the main learning objectives Look into teaching contents of german math classes (grade 8 to 12) Merge these outcomes to compose the learning objectives for my course  One and Two were quite straightforward.</description>

Initially, I was asked to write the related work abstract for my thesis this week to summarize all the relevant papers and other sources I&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled upon so far. While googling (yes, I google a lot these days) how to best write related work abstracts, I figured why not do some general research on master thesis requirements (yes, I should&amp;rsquo;ve probably googled that a while ago).</description>

This week I started my research for my masters thesis. To say &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m struggling&amp;rdquo; would be an understatement. The research part of any thesis is probably the most crucial part of the whole odyssey. It&amp;rsquo;s the part that sets the tone for the next 6 months. I guess struggling with the research will mean less struggle with the rest of the process. Hopefully…right?</description>
