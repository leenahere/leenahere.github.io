      <description>In 2016 and 2017 I wrote my thesis about conversational interfaces. My goal was to establish a design and development process for conversational interfaces. I mainly based my theories on Pangaro&amp;rsquo;s design for conversation, Grice&amp;rsquo;s cooperative principles and &amp;ldquo;The Media Equation&amp;rdquo; by Reeves and Nass.
To proof my theoretical concepts I programmed a facebook chatbot with wit.ai that was able to look up recipes. The bot was tested in a live trial and in a survey testers were able to judge the effectiveness of the conversation with the chatbot.</description>

      <description>In 2017 I was part of the team that participated in the Audi Autonomous Driving Cup. My main task was to implement Occupancy Grid Maps, which were used for object detection and parking.
The following year I took over team leadership and focused on the implementation of the World Service.
